First, make sure you're in the correct folder.

In vscode, right-click this folder (jwebserver) and click "Open In Integrated Terminal" (fourth option from the top).

Or, simply open a terminal and enter "cd src/main/java/be/craftcode/java25/java21/jwebserver"
(copy the above command and shift + insert to paste in terminal).

To serve the page locally (accessible on your own machine),
once you're in the folder you want to serve, simply write the command "jwebserver" and hit enter. 
The index.html webpage will be available on your machine at http://localhost:8000 .

Hit CTRL-C in the terminal to stop the server.
